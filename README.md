## Data Cleaning for Customer Segmentation Dataset

### Goal
The goal of this project is to clean and preprocess the Customer Segmentation dataset for further analysis. This involves handling common data inconsistencies, such as:

1. **Missing Values**: Identifying and addressing any missing values in key columns like Age, Profession, and Work_Experience.
2. **Duplicate Records**: Removing any duplicate entries based on ID to ensure data integrity.
3. **Inconsistent Formats**: Standardizing categorical columns (e.g., Gender, Ever_Married, Graduated, Spending_Score) to ensure uniformity across the dataset.
4. **Outliers**: Identifying and removing outliers, particularly in numeric columns such as Age, to ensure the data is within a reasonable range.
5. **Data Standardization**: Ensuring consistency in values (e.g., uppercasing and trimming spaces in string fields) and addressing any inconsistencies in data entries.

This cleaned dataset will then be ready for deeper analysis and modeling, particularly for segmentation and customer insights.
